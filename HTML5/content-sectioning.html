    <!-- In this html file all the Content sectioning elements are detailed -->
    <header>
        <code><header></code> usually includes a logo, company name, search feature, and possibly the global navigation
        or a slogan. It is generally located at the top of the page.
        <nav>This is a navigation text inside <code><header></code>tag</nav>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h1>Heading level 1</h1>
        <h2>Heading level 2</h2>
        <h3>Heading level 3</h3>
        <h4>Heading level 4</h4>
        <h5>Heading level 5</h5>
        <h6>Heading level 6</h6>
        The content of a <code><main></code> element should be unique to the document. Content that is repeated across a
        set of documents or document sections such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and
        search forms shouldn't be included unless the search form is the main function of the page.
        <aside>The <code><aside></code> HTML element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly
            related to the document's main content.</aside>
        <article>The <code><article></code> HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page,
            application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in
            syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product
            card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.
        </article>
    </main>
    <footer>
        A <code><footer></code> typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links
        to related documents.
